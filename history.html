                    NSL started out as, and aims to continue as a small meetup for regional players with a hint of competition. This year marks the event's second iteration, and is
                    accompanied by several improvements as we work to bring it to new heights.

                            The first iteration of NSL, held in August 2022, was formed from a small discussion in the osu!MN Discord server about meeting up at a local internet cafe,
                            the Left Click Lounge. Over the following few weeks, the idea matured into a fully fledged event and we decided to rent out the cafe to host a tournament.
                            The event was quickly put together by a small team, and eventually culminated in a 10 hour event at the cafe that brought many members of osu!MN together
                            to compete and hang out in person for the first time. All things considered, it was a great success for something so sudden, and created a unique moment in
                            the server's history.

                            This year, we're aiming for the same feel as the original event, but with a little more polish from the extra time we've had to plan things out.
                            Moving to the Wisdom venue as been a major part of this, and has given the event the flexibility it needs to grow and thrive with our ambitions.
                            However, regardless of how things change, our team has always been committed to keeping the event accessable and tied to its roots. Because of this,
                            we never intend to charge admission, nor will we be excluding anyone from participating. NSL is for the community and by the community, so stay tuned,
                            because we're confident we'll be able to deliver on an even greater experience this time around.
